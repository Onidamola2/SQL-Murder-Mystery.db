SQL Murder Mystery: An Investigative Data Project


Overview
This project showcases the practical application of SQL in a real-world problem-solving scenario. Using the sql-murder-mystery.db database, I acted as a data detective, leveraging structured queries and logical deduction to solve a complex crime. The objective was to identify the perpetrator and uncover the mastermind who hired them.
Challenge & Approach
The challenge required a step-by-step investigation of a database containing crime scene reports, witness testimonies, and various personal and financial records. My approach involved a methodical series of queries to progressively narrow down the suspect pool and connect the dots in the digital "paper trail."
Key Investigative Techniques:
•	Filtering with Conditions (WHERE): The investigation began by precisely filtering the data to locate the initial crime scene report, using specific conditions such as date (2018-01-15) and location (SQL City).
•	Exploring Relationships with Joins (JOIN): By joining multiple tables, I connected disparate pieces of information. This allowed me to link suspects to their interviews, gym check-ins, and financial transactions, effectively following the digital trail left by the criminals.
•	Pattern Matching (LIKE): To handle vague or partial information from witness statements, I utilized pattern-matching queries to search for names and descriptions, helping to pinpoint potential suspects from a broad set of records.
•	Aggregation and Functions (COUNT, MAX, DISTINCT): I applied aggregate functions to analyze behavioral patterns, such as counting the number of gym check-ins for a specific time period, which were crucial for verifying witness accounts.
•	Logical Operators (AND, OR): These operators were essential for refining searches, allowing me to combine multiple conditions to pinpoint the precise information needed, for example, identifying individuals who met both a location and a time criterion.
Outcome
Through a combination of structured queries and logical deduction, I successfully solved the case, identifying the murderer and the person who hired them. This project serves as a strong demonstration of how SQL can be applied beyond theoretical knowledge into practical, investigative analytics and complex problem-solving.
